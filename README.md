# Buzzshit

Buzzshit is a small JavaScript library to replace any bullshit words in a string by something a bit more realistic.

###  What is a bullshit word?

> It is something that no one truly understands, not even nerds, but it still used by marketing guys to sell things nobody can do.

Another definition could be:

> Any word that makes no sense in a LinkedIn post.

### Usage

```
buzzshit(input[, replacement])
```

##### Parameters

`input`<br />
A string as-if provided by your average business manager.

`replacement` (optional)<br />
Whatever you would like buzzwords to be replaced with.

###### Return value

The string as it should have been from the beginning.

### Examples

``` JavaScript
import buzzshit from 'buzzshit';

buzzshit('We at [company name] love blockchain!');
// -> "We at [company name] love ðŸ’©!"
//
buzzshit('I decided to do a digital detox before our disruptive ICO :)');
// -> "I decided to do a ðŸ’© before our ðŸ’© ðŸ’© :)"

buzzshit('Our engineers are working on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.', 'BULLSHIT');
// -> "Our engineers are working on state-of-the-art BULLSHIT algorithms."
```
